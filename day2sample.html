    <h2>What is HTML</h2>
    <P>
     ParagraphParagraphs are the group of sentences combined together, about a certain topic.<br> is a very important form of writing as we write almost everything in paragraphs, </br>be it an answer, essay, story, emails, etc. We can say that a well-structured paragraph is the essence of good writing. <br> purposes of the paragraph are to give information, to explain something, to tell a story, and to convince someone that our idea is right.</br>


Paragraphs are blocks of textual content that segment out a larger piece <br>of writing—stories, novels, articles, creative writing, or professional writing portions—making it less complicated to read and understand.</br> Excellent paragraphs are an available writing skill for plenty of types of literature, and proper writers<br> can substantially beautify the clarity of their news, essays, or </br>fiction writing whilst constructing nicely.
